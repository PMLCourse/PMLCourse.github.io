# Principles of Machine Learning

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and applications of machine learning. Designed for both undergraduate and graduate students from diverse academic backgrounds, the course balances theoretical foundations with practical implementations.

## Course Overview

Students will learn:
- **Fundamental machine learning algorithms** and their mathematical underpinnings.
- How to **apply machine learning** to real-world problems.
- Practical programming exercises using **Python** and popular ML libraries.

## Learning Approach

The course includes:
- **Lectures** on core concepts.
- **Hands-on coding exercises** using Python and machine learning libraries.
- A balance between **theoretical concepts** (for research) and **practical skills** (for industry applications).

By the end of this course, students will have the knowledge and experience to understand, implement, and evaluate machine learning models effectively.
